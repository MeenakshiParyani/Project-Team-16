# Idea 1 :- Booking A Ride using Programmable Bot
The traditional approach to find a nearby event happening involves looking up for that event on web browser either on computer or mobile phone. If one is interested in going to the event he/she has to book a cab using ‘cab booking’ applications and enter details such as destination /type of cab(shared/private) manually. This project aims to automate the process by feeding voice commands to a bot program that will book the cab to the specified event venue automatically. The bot will use machine learning algorithms to handle the different sentence formations that could be used to book the cab and parse the user input in to a command understandable by the program, it will then communicate with APIs of the specified app to book the ride for ex – Uber/Lyft etc. The bot can be integrated with any one of the chat messengers like Skype, Facebook Messenger or devices such as Alexa.
###Prof: Nope not enough challenge in this project for 4 people and there is no novelty, 10 other bots exist
# Idea 2 :- Customizing Alexa as a Personal Assistant

In our busy lives, we often tend to miss keeping track of important things in and around us. We generally don’t make checklists for our regular chores like going to office, going to school, packing for a hike, etc. For example: while leaving home for work, we sometimes forget to carry our essentials like ID cards, mobile, wallet, laptop, etc. After driving for an hour, it’s difficult to come back to fetch those things. What if we have an assistant who could help us go through our entire checklist before leaving? What if someone could check the weather for us and remind us to take an umbrella if it’s raining?

In this project, we aim to personalize Alexa for our needs. For the above example, the user will tell Alexa that he is leaving for work. In return, Alexa will check the weather and  respond with a certain checklist which is customized by the user like:
a)	Remember to take your Wallet, keys, ID card, laptop and mobile
b)	Make sure you switch off all the light.
c)	It’s raining outside, don’t forget to take your umbrella
