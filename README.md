# Idea 1 :- Booking A Ride using Programmable Bot
The traditional approach to find a nearby event happening involves looking up for that event on web browser either on computer or mobile phone. If one is interested in going to the event he/she has to book a cab using ‘cab booking’ applications and enter details such as destination /type of cab(shared/private) manually. This project aims to automate the process by feeding voice commands to a bot program that will book the cab to the specified event venue automatically. The bot will use machine learning algorithms to handle the different sentence formations that could be used to book the cab and parse the user input in to a command understandable by the program, it will then communicate with APIs of the specified app to book the ride for ex – Uber/Lyft etc.
